# Shoppr
Barebones online marketplace for the Shopify 2019 Developer challenge

# TODO:

- Complete base functionality (i.e.: Get all, Get product, "Buy" product);
- Add cart functionality;
- Add access token for security;
- Improve code quality;
- Specify installation steps (potentially set things up within a docker container?);
- Add tests;
- Add TravisCI to pipeline;
